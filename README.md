[Class Contagion](https://github.com/Yamilhb/yolo-class-contagion) is an excercise with yolo that aims to explore the tracking capabilities of the model.

The goal of the project is to find, in real time, the person who made the action that we are looking for (the event). To do that, we have to detect the person involved in the event, and for simplicity, I will work with objects (we can think that the actions must be done with objects, for example, the action of *shooting* must be done with a *gun*).
